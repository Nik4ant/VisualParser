## Why Obsidian?
In current state of project there is only 1 developer - creator [Nik4ant](https://github.com/Nik4ant), but in future there might be a team of developers. By using Obsidian it will be much easier to understand main ideas, structure and in-depth features.
(It's not sponsored by Obsidian, [Nik4ant](https://github.com/Nik4ant) just likes this software)
